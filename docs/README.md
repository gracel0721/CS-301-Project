# Execution Info
In order to execute the [jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gIpSiYXYnk1yEa9cpxmyAIs4dtay9cUI?usp=sharing&authuser=1#scrollTo=v902IqTIM9UJ), we recommend using Colab. Make sure you have accepted the rules of the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-pog-series-s01e02/rules), and have access to your Kaggle API key. You can either upload your key directly to your Colab environment, or you can uncomment the indicated line in the first code cell of the notebook and upload your key directly from your local machine. Then the notebook should execute without errors.
