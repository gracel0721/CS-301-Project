### Abstract
### Introduction
    We were tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm to classify and predict the music genre of unlabeled audio clips. In this day and age, with the massive amount of music coming out and music data currently available, music style and genres are key ways to classify the music. They are the primary modes used to group music together and search for specific types of music. They take into account different features such as rhythm, melody and harmony. And with the vast amount of music data, it is no longer feasible to manually classify all the music that exists. With the rapid development of neural networks it is important to explore this to see how it can assist in automated music classification. 

  

### Related Work
  We reviewed a similar paper published by Tecnológico de Monterrey, México titled, [__Data-Driven Techniques for Music Genre Recognition__](https://csitcp.com/paper/10/109csit05.pdf). Their approach considered multiple different algorithms and tested them against each other. The algorithms used included a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN), Random Forest (RF), and Linear Regression. Multiple implementations of each algorithm were used, with  both random forest algorithms ranking highest in both train and test accuracy. Additionally, we looked at some of the Kaggle submissions for the competition to see if there was anything that we considered that did not work, or worked really well. We decided to utilize a Neural Network to compare the bpm of each audio file, and the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). There were multiple kaggle entries that utilized this coefficient in some way, so we decided to implement it into our work.
